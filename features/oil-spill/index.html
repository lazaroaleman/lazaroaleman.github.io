            <p>
                The worst marine petroleum disaster in U.S. history, the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill — or BP oil
                spill, as it’s most commonly called — marred beaches, estuaries and marshes along 1,000-plus miles
                of
                coastline, caused immeasurable harm to sea and shore wildlife, and hurt the fishing and tourism
                industries in coastal communities across Northwest Florida. Some six years later, however, the spill
                appears to be all but history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tourism is reported at unprecedented levels, as sun-and-surf lovers again flock to Emerald Coast
                beaches; fishing, a major component of Florida’s economy, is back on track; Gulf seafood, shunned
                as
                risky following the spill, is once more considered safe; and dolphins, pelicans and other seabirds
                appear plentiful, attesting to their hardiness.
            </p>
            <p>
                BP and the federal government, meanwhile, long ago ceased their concerted cleanup/mitigation operations.
                BP, the five affected states and Washington last year reached a landmark settlement resolving all
                government claims and assuring billions of dollars for restoration projects. And the news media and
                public have mostly moved on, their attention captured by new concerns and disasters.
            </p>
            <p>
                BP, in a 40-page paper in March 2015, touted the Gulf’s resiliency, essentially declaring the
                disaster
                over.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Areas that were affected are recovering and data BP has collected and analyzed to date do not indicate
                a significant long-term impact to the population of any Gulf species,” the report states.
            </p>
            <p>
                The state and federal organizations that manage the nearly 200 Gulf species considered commercially or
                recreationally valuable seemingly agree.
            </p>
            <p>
                “If there were any impacts on the fishery population, I can’t see them,” says Luis Barbieri,
                director of
                Marine Fisheries Research at the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute in St. Petersburg. “I know some
                parts of the ecosystem have been more impacted. But in terms of the fisheries, I really haven’t
                seen
                anything that dramatic.
            </p>
            <p>
                “So yes, overall and in general, the abundance and sustainability of Gulf stocks are OK,” Barbieri
                asserts, allowing that some species are overfished, others are undergoing overfishing, yet others are
                rebuilding and a few are struggling for reasons other than the spill.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not everyone is convinced normalcy has returned, however. Scientists caution that the spill’s full
                environmental and ecological effects are still playing out. Of note, the Deepwater Horizon Natural
                Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council (composed of state and federal agencies tasked with assessing
                the spill’s impact and recommending solutions) in 2015 declared that full recovery could vary from
                decades to hundreds of years. Oil, meanwhile, continues washing up on Escambia County beaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s much better than 2010, but you can still go on the beach and find marble-sized tar balls,”
                says
                Chips Kirschenfeld, interim director of the Escambia County Department of Natural Resource Management.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many businesses that submitted claims to BP, moreover, had yet to be reimbursed in early 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The fact there are still millions of dollars’ worth of private claims pending means there are
                individuals and businesses that haven’t been reimbursed for their losses,” avers University of West
                Florida (UWF) economist Rick Harper.
            </p>
            <p>
                Which is to say that six years out, the spill’s economic and environmental ramifications continue
                reverberating. The seafood industry well illustrates the point.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Florida is dubbed the “Fishing Capital of the World” for good reason. Economically, the state’s
                commercial fisheries (ranked among the country’s top-producing) and marine recreational fisheries
                (ranked the nation’s best) have an annual impact in the billions of dollars and support hundreds of
                thousands of jobs, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and
                the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). The Gulf of Mexico, moreover, is rated one
                of the world’s most productive fisheries, second only to Alaska in the United States. It therefore
                stands to reason that the ruptured well, which spewed oil for 87 days between April 20 and July 15,
                2010, would cause “significant socioeconomic injuries to the Gulf of Mexico fishing industry,” as a 2011
                congressional paper notes.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Commercial and recreational fisheries are among the main activities supporting the economy and social
                well-being of many Gulf coastal communities,” the Congressional Research Service report states.
            </p>
            <p>
                The spill’s most immediate impact resulted from the closing of tens of thousands of square miles of
                federal and state waters to fishing to ensure the seafood’s safety. The data suggest the
                closing’s
                impact on commercial fishing. NOAA, for example, shows that Gulf landings, or catches, dropped from
                1,435,665,309 pounds in 2009 to 1,072,068,111 pounds in 2010, then increased to 1,792,550,312 pounds in
                2011. Specific to Florida’s Panhandle, FWC data show amberjack landings at Panama City, for
                example,
                dropped from 80,554 pounds in 2009 to 39,364 pounds in 2010, and climbed to 66,275 pounds 2011. The
                decreased landings in 2010 largely hold true across species for Apalachicola, Destin, Panama City and
                Pensacola. Landings, of course, translate into revenues for harvesters.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s more difficult to gauge the spill’s economic impact on recreational fishing. That’s
                because, unlike
                commercial fishermen who must report all catches, recreational fishermen’s landings are calculated
                based
                on surveys, interviews and samplings. Even so, a University of Florida study published in 2014 found
                that anglers lost $545 million during the Gulf fisheries’ closures. Nor was the impact limited to
                recreational fishing; it rippled to ancillary businesses that supported or depended on the industry,
                such as bait-and-tackle shops, restaurants and hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, recreational and commercial landings are back to normal, allowing for year-to-year fluctuations
                because of availability of species, number of trips, market prices and such.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Absolutely, the Gulf seems to be thriving,” says Eddie Morgan, general manager of Harbor Docks Seafood
                Market in Destin. “Our seafood market’s as busy as ever. It’s hard to say on a week-to-week
                basis, but
                we definitely have 30,000-pound weeks and 20,000-pound days sometimes. Some species have rebounded
                completely. There are as many red snappers as ever. And tuna fishing seems to be as good as it’s
                ever&nbsp;been.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Business is great,” concurs Frank Patti, of Joe Patti’s Seafood, a Pensacola business dating from
                1930.
                During the Gulf fisheries’ closure, Patti coped by switching to East Coast and Lower Caribbean
                products.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The customers were leery about the product during those days, but we survived and we’re now doing
                great,” Patti says.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                A&nbsp;possibly longer-lasting effect of the spill was the public’s perception that Gulf seafood
                was
                unsafe.
            </p>
            <p>
                “People were afraid even the year after to eat the fish because they were afraid they were tainted,”
                says Pam Anderson, operations manager of Captain Anderson’s Marina in Panama City, which runs a
                seafood
                market and offers deep-sea fishing trips, charter boats and dinner/sightseeing cruises.
            </p>
            <p>
                Morgan agrees.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Even after they opened the waters back up, there was uncertainty with the public,” he says. “We knew
                the fish were safe, but a lot of people still didn’t trust it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Bob Jones, executive director of the Tallahassee-based Southeastern Fisheries Association, which
                represents commercial fishermen from Texas to Maryland, underscores the point.
            </p>
            <p>
                “One of the biggest things that hurt us is we lost our seafood brand,” Jones says. “Everybody said,
                ‘Don’t eat Gulf fish or shrimp, they taste like oil.’ ‘You don’t have to put oil in the
                pan; they’ve got
                enough oil to cook themselves.’”
            </p>
            <p>
                Where Jones differs from the others is his belief that the negative perception persists.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Absolutely,” he says. “I’m talking about today; it’s still out there.”
            </p>
            <p>
                This is despite assurances from state and federal officials and researchers that Gulf seafood is safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Florida, for example, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services ensures the safety of Gulf
                seafood. It reports screening thousands of seafood samples since the spill and finding that “all are
                well below the FDA levels of concern.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Steven Murawski, a marine scientist and professor with the University of South Florida (USF), is one
                whose research links the spill to tumors, skin lesions and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
                concentrations in some key species. He affirms the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services’
                findings.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’m not worried about the seafood’s safety,” Murawski says. “I have studied this fairly
                significantly.
                And in terms of both the government and independent research, there is no significant public health risk
                for consuming the seafood.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Jones doesn’t dispute the scientific findings. His argument is that not enough has been done to
                convey
                the point to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Probably one of the bitterest pills to swallow for the industry is that we can’t get any BP money
                for
                marketing,” Jones says. “And we know how important marketing is, because BP must have spent billions
                marketing its brand after the spill.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally speaking, however, the consensus in the fishing community is that things are back to normal.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s much better,” says Anderson of Captain Anderson’s Marina. “Some of us are still
                recovering from
                the losses we incurred. It takes a while for businesses to totally recover clientele and rebuild. But
                2015 has been the best year we’ve had since the spill.”
            </p>
            <p>
                As for dolphin sightings, Anderson says they are common, notwithstanding documented evidence of their
                increased mortalities because of the spill.
            </p>
            <p>
                “About 80 or 90 percent of the time, guests will see dolphins,” she says. “In our area, fishermen will
                tell you dolphins are plentiful.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Reimbursements are the notable outlier.
            </p>
            <p>
                “We have multiple businesses between our 12 restaurants and the seafood market,” says Morgan of Harbor
                Docks. “We’ve been reimbursed for some claims, but we still have others ongoing.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Several reasons account for the non-reimbursement of losses some six years later. One is that not every
                spill-affected business was able or eligible to file a claim. Of the 382,192 claims filed, moreover,
                tens of thousands were still in resolution or appeals processes in early 2016. Yet others were denied or
                reimbursed at lower levels. Then there were the intangible losses — unrecoverable because unquantifiable
                — such as damage to natural resources, quality of life or brand name.
            </p>
            <p>
                UWF economist Harper explains that the court-set damage test required that businesses demonstrate a
                V-shape (dramatic dip and rebound) revenue loss pattern to qualify for compensation. If failing this
                test — except in an area where damages were presumed — compensation wasn’t likely, he says.
            </p>
            <p>
                He cites as an example a beer distributor whose warehouse was inland. If that business couldn’t
                prove
                the V-shape pattern, it wasn’t eligible for compensation.
            </p>
            <p>
                “In Florida, businesses too far north of the spill or away from the coastline, even though they may have
                experienced revenue losses, were not compensated,” Harper says.
            </p>
            <p>
                He talks also of damages that can’t be tabulated in dollars and cents, but are real nonetheless.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You don’t pay for seeing Florida’s natural beauty,” Harper says. “But the flip side is that
                when you
                lose it, that kind of damage can never be compensated.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Another of the uncompensated losses, he posits, resulted from businesses’ failure to realize
                reasonably
                expected higher returns on theirs or a public entity’s substantial investment to upgrade services.
            </p>
            <p>
                “What would your business have been, given that Southwest Airlines started flying passengers into the
                brand-new Panama City airport in 2010?” Harper asks by way of example. “Well, if you couldn’t
                demonstrate that V-shape pattern, maybe you weren’t eligible to be compensated, because your
                revenues
                didn’t dip. Or maybe you invested additional dollars in advertising or providing greater amenities.
                If
                you’d done that, you would have expected to see your revenue rise in 2010, but the test for damage
                was
                that you demonstrated it fell and then rose.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Or a charter fishing business that worked hard to get a client who visited regularly,” he continues.
                “If they lost that client for a summer because of the spill and that client went off and discovered
                charter fishing off North Carolina, it may be that business lost that person forever.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The bottom line, Harper says, is that not all spill-related losses are recoverable or even quantifiable.
            </p>
            <p>
                “So to the original question, some losses are difficult to calculate, some are nonmonetary, claims are
                still pending, and some businesses didn’t meet the V-shape revenue requirements,” he says. “So yes,
                as
                the settlement process winds up, I expect many damages will never be compensated.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The Congressional Research Service report to Congress touches on the potential for irreversible losses
                to the industry. Not only did the spill interrupt the Gulf’s seafood supply, the report notes, it
                also
                disrupted demand for Gulf seafood, causing buyers to switch to other regions or imports for substitutes.
                To the extent that Gulf seafood producers weren’t able to recapture these markets, the losses were
                permanent, the report suggests.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The spill’s long-term environmental and ecological damages also pose potential consequences for the

                Wade Jeffrey, a biology professor and director of the UWF Center for Environmental Diagnostics and
                Bioremediation, conducts research in the Gulf, especially post-Deepwater Horizon. Jeffrey’s
                expertise is
                microbial growth and the food web. He points out that although resiliency is evident at the microbial
                level, some research suggests a significant post-spill shift in the bacterial community. His own
                research, interestingly, finds that sunlight (think Sunshine State) makes oil more toxic and inhibitory
                for microbial growth. Given the ecosystem’s interdependency, the findings suggest at minimum a
                potential
                impact on the food web and ultimately the larger fish populations.

                Jeffrey disagrees with BP’s assessment that the Gulf is largely back to normal. For one thing, he
                says,
                the extent of the spill’s damage is unknowable, as the Gulf’s preexisting condition was
                unknown due to a
                lack of pre-spill data. Secondly, he says, the Gulf’s vastness and complexity make it impossible to
                assign it a whole value.
            </p>
            <p>
                “To say the Gulf as a whole is OK is pushing it, because there are localized areas where absolutely it
                hasn’t recovered and it’s not going to recover for a long time,” Jeffrey says. “As to what the
                average
                person sees when he goes to the beach, it looks fine. And that’s great, because tourism is up and
                people
                are fishing. But as an ecological question, it depends on the specific question asked, where you ask it
                about and how you ask it. That’s where the long-term things come in. So I can’t agree the Gulf
                is back
                to what it was in 2009, because that’s washing over those places where it was really impacted.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He cites as examples the fair amount of oil remaining on the seafloor, severely affected coral
                communities that haven’t recovered, and oil-linked heart defects in tuna larvae.

                “But what people want to know is can they catch red snapper, and for that part, yeah,” he says. “But
                what the jury’s still out on, in terms of the red snapper and other fisheries, is whether 2010 will
                have
                an effect on their long-term populations.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, Jeffrey posits, the science, environment and economy are interconnected.

                “If the water’s clean, people go to the beach,” he says. “If the water’s fouled for whatever
                reason,
                people won’t go to the beaches. If the fish are there, people fish and spend money on charter
                boats. If
                the fish population crashes, the economics of the fishing industry falls apart. It’s all dependent
                on
                the Gulf working the way the ecosystem is supposed to work.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Murawski, of USF, likewise finds BP’s declaration premature.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s way premature, given the amount of environmental health effects that have been seen in
                turtle,
                bird and fish populations and in oysters and other species that have an economic outcome and that are
                major players in the ecosystem,” he says.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although he doesn’t necessarily see fish populations crashing in the future as a consequence of the
                spill, Murawski does see potential generational effects because of the die-offs in certain species.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Fish like red snapper, for example, are very long-lived in the absence of fishing,” he says. “They can
                live 30 years or more. If they’re not there to participate, you have to look at a lifetime
                potential
                drop in reproduction and new egg production. So yeah, the spill can potentially have ramifications for
                decades.”

                If the spill has a silver lining, one possibility is a greater understanding of the Gulf’s
                workings.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The Gulf was phenomenally understudied before the spill,” Jeffrey says. “We now know a whole lot more
                about it and are learning more with every project. So we may not be able to tell for sure what’s a
                direct result of the spill because we didn’t have the pre-spill data, but we have a lot of data
                since,
                should something else happen.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Another possibility is greater public awareness and appreciation of the Gulf’s ecology and
                vulnerability.

                “It helped people recognize that the health of our Gulf economy is intrinsically linked to the health of
                our environment, and that the Gulf, while a vast and bountiful resource, is in fact a dynamic system
                that may not always be able to provide all of the natural resources we rely on for food, fun and the
                economy,” says Bethany Kraft of the Ocean Conservancy, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit environmental
                advocacy group that helps formulate ocean policy at the federal and state levels.

                “History,” Mark Twain remarked, “does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.” Indeed, as recently as
                2015, separate incidents on oil-processing platforms belonging to the state-owned Mexican company Pemex
                killed several workers and spewed oil into the Gulf. Given the continuation of offshore drilling in
                these waters, it isn’t inconceivable that another major mishap — whether human- or nature-caused —
                will
                one day occur. That’s something to ponder as the BP oil spill recedes into memory.
