                By: Lazaro Aleman
            </p>
            <p>
                You won’t find Dick Bailar’s name on the roster of state legislators, or even of elected officials, in
                Jefferson County. But you will find this retired minister’s imprint on many a legislative measure
                involving funding or other state aid for the fiscally constrained county. And you also will find him at
                the center of many a quasi-judicial group working for the social and economic betterment of the still
                largely rural community 26 miles east of Tallahassee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Indeed, Bailar’s efforts over the years, in part or in whole, have resulted, among other things, in
                construction of a $400,000 facility for Jefferson County’s boys’ and girls’ scouting groups; the
                realization of millions in state and federal funding for the enhancement of affordable housing and the
                restoration and preservation of historic structures; and the state purchase of land at the head of the
                Wacissa River, a pristine body of water that the community wants preserved and protected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, Bailar is heading separate efforts to establish a countywide sanitary sewer system and
                establish an emergency operations center. The first would promote economic development and protect water
                quality by eliminating septic tanks, and the second would better prepare the Jefferson County for the
                eventuality of a natural or manmade disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
                Amazingly, Bailar undertakes all these projects voluntarily, based on what he terms “an extension of my
                life’s ministry.
            </p>
            <p>
                “My ministry has always been most comfortable when it addresses not, ‘Are you saved?’ but rather, ‘How
                are you spending yourself?’” Bailar said. “When all is said and done, does it matter one whit that you
                have walked this Earth? What have you done to help people be better clothed, better fed, better
                educated, and so forth? That’s our responsibility.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The former minister served a Congregational church in Coral Gables for 25 years. Bailar retired to
                Jefferson County in 1991 after being told by his optometrist that he suffered from a degenerative eye
                disease that would leave him blind within a matter of years, and by his orthopedist that he would
                require surgery on both knees and might have to have one leg amputated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bailar, 78, laughs telling the story, although he has since undergone three knee surgeries and now is
                legally blind.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well, God, I was losing my eyes and I was going to be lame!” he said. “I said, ‘OK, Schatzi (his pet
                name for his German wife, Friedel – it means “little treasure”), this is the end. If I have only so much
                time left, I want to spend it with you.’ Within three months, I had retired and we came up here.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Not one to sit around, even in retirement, Bailar immediately plunged into the design and construction
                of “Waldesruh” (“Tranquility of the Woods”), the couple’s imposing, almost 4,000 square-foot, two-story
                alpine manor house with a 28-foot-high cathedral ceiling, European-styled gilded birdcage elevator,
                hardwood floors, scroll-staved interior balcony, and large murals by Friedel both on the interior and
                exterior walls. A woodworker by avocation – he earned his contractor’s license at night school in Miami
                – Bailar over the succeeding years built another 13 architecturally correct Bavarian structures on the
                property, including a pub, dock house, gazebo and several guesthouses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, to look at the beautifully manicured estate with its waterfowl-filled woodland pond and charming
                cottages, it’s difficult to imagine the largely wooded and overgrown five-acre tract that the Bailars
                purchased in 1979.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Our first task was to clear and contour the land, as well as have a path cut into the property so that
                it could be accessed, and have electricity and a septic tank and well installed,” Bailar said. “That
                allowed us to hook up our small RV and spend our vacations there, weeding, cutting, chopping and
                dreaming.”
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1985, during a five-month sabbatical leave, the Bailars, with the help of “a crusty curmudgeon of a
                carpenter,” constructed what was to be the village’s first structure, a small cottage that became their
                first home in 1991.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back on the creation of the village, Bailar marvels that they ever attempted the project, let
                alone succeeded at it. Even today, the upkeep of the place demands a great deal of time and energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                “At times, it seems a daunting task,” Bailar said. “But when the setting sun casts its golden glow on
                the shore of our pond, the two of us hold hands and whisper a fervent, ‘Danke, Leiber Gott’ (‘Thank you,
                dear God’).”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
                As for his immersion in the local community, it began in 1992 when a former Jefferson County
                commissioner paid him an introductory visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                “At the time, I didn’t even know what district I was in,” Bailar said. “But we had a wonderful
                conversation down by our dock, and he said, ‘What are you doing with your life?’
            </p>
            <p>
                I said, ‘Well, I’m building, but I’m at a point where I need to do something, and I don’t know quite
                where I’m going.’ And he said, ‘Why don’t you come to our commission meetings? We’re a small county, and
                we need people to help us do things.’ And so I started going to the meetings and got hooked.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Indeed, barring travel (he and Friedel get away every chance they get, notwithstanding his eyesight and
                knee problems), Bailar has attended commission meetings and workshops regularly for the last 15 years,
                to the point that some jokingly refer to him as the sixth commissioner. That’s because Bailar doesn’t
                simply attend, he participates, offering solutions and volunteering whenever called upon.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s not that I have these great talents,” Bailar said, “it’s just that a void is there to be filled.
                So there are these situations that arise and you say, ‘Fine, I’ve got the time. I’ll go see this
                senator, this representative, this department head,’ or whatever. And so you end up being the point man
                a lot of times, but you always have some really good committees and people who are working with you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                On average, Bailar figures he spends about four hours daily on community work, whether it’s writing
                letters and e-mails, making phone calls, attending meetings or visiting with legislators, most of whom
                he is on a first-name basis with.
            </p>
            <p>
                “We can’t refuse Dick Bailar,” state Rep. Will Kendrick, R-Carrabelle, likes to say.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Dick is the guy who makes the wheels roll,” said County Commissioner Felix Joyner, founder of the
                Jefferson County Legislative Lobbying Committee, of which Bailar is a member. “He has no agenda. He does
                it for the love of this county.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Bailar takes the accolades in stride. Gregarious, irreverent, erudite and a born raconteur, he is no
                newcomer to the halls of power, or to community involvement and controversy for that matter, as a quick
                review of his colorful life attests. A World War II infantryman and a CIA operative during the Cold War,
                Bailar, among other things, has parachuted out of planes; helped rescue individuals from behind the Iron
                Curtain; founded an interfaith organization; hosted radio shows; interviewed figures such as Presidents
                Kennedy and Nixon; met with President Carter and Pope John Paul II; marched with the Rev. Martin Luther
                King Jr.; and been written about by James Michener, late author of “Hawaii” and other
                bestsellers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
                Bailar has also had his detractors, been called a liberal and a troublemaker, and has had stones and
                rotten eggs thrown at him during marches.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I think that anytime you get in the public arena and you take a position, you’re liable,” Bailar said.
                “Frankly, I’m not a confrontational guy. I would much rather meet with people and talk and lay issues
                out and try to find places to compromise and be ameliorative. You don’t like to back people into a
                corner. But sometimes you simply have to stand up for what you believe, and you have to go there, even
                if you’re scared.”
            </p>
            <p>
                His take on his post-retirement community involvement is that, in the final analysis, it’s giving him
                back more than he is contributing.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s giving me a raison d’etre,” Bailar said. “I have a reason for being. And I love it. I see myself
                as a facilitator. It’s exciting to see a need and then to cobble together a group of people to go and
                address that need.”
